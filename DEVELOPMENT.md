# VSAG Developer Guide

Welcome to the developer guide for VSAG! This guide is designed to provide both new and experienced contributors with a comprehensive resource for understanding the project's codebase, development processes, and best practices.

Whether you're an open-source enthusiast looking to make your first contribution or a seasoned developer seeking insights into the project's architecture, the guide aims to streamline your onboarding process and empower you to contribute effectively.

Let's dive in and explore how you can become an integral part of our vibrant open-source community!

## Development Environment

There are two ways to build and develop the VSAG project now.

### Use Docker(recommended)

```

Build target behavior:

- `make debug` builds the default minimal configuration. It does not enable tests, examples, tools, Python bindings, or `mockimpl` unless they are explicitly turned on.
- `make dev` builds the full developer configuration with tests, examples, tools, Python bindings, and `mockimpl` enabled.
- `make test`, `make asan`, `make tsan`, and the related parallel test targets automatically enable tests and `mockimpl`.
- `make release` follows the same minimal defaults as `make debug`. Enable optional components explicitly when needed, for example `make release VSAG_ENABLE_TOOLS=ON`.
- Linux and macOS use the same dependency-script plus `make` entry points for the core C++ build. Use `./scripts/deps/install_deps.sh` first, then run the usual `make` target. The current macOS validation scope is `make debug`, `make release`, and `make test` on arm64; Python wheel packaging remains Linux-focused.

## CMake Build Options

VSAG provides several CMake options to customize the build:

### BLAS Library Options

- **`ENABLE_INTEL_MKL`** (default: `OFF`)
  - Enable Intel MKL as the BLAS backend (x86_64 platforms only)
  - When disabled, OpenBLAS is used instead
  - MKL resolution uses `MKL_PATH`, `OMP_PATH`, and `MKL_INCLUDE_PATH` as CMake cache
    overrides when the libraries are not installed in standard locations

### System Third-Party Dependencies

VSAG can reuse third-party libraries already provided by the host system or by a parent CMake
project instead of always building bundled copies.

- **`VSAG_USE_SYSTEM_DEPS`** (default: `AUTO`)
  - `AUTO` — use a system / pre-existing copy when one is found, fall back to the bundled
    build otherwise.
  - `ON` — require a system copy of every supported dependency; fail configuration if any
    of them is missing.
  - `OFF` — always build bundled copies, ignoring system packages.

- **`VSAG_USE_SYSTEM_<DEP>`** (default: empty — inherit `VSAG_USE_SYSTEM_DEPS`)
  - Per-dependency override. Set to `AUTO`, `ON`, or `OFF` to override the global policy
    for a single dependency.

**Currently supported dependencies for system reuse:** `OPENBLAS`.

Additional dependencies will be enabled in follow-up changes.

#### OpenBLAS

When `VSAG_USE_SYSTEM_OPENBLAS=ON` (or inherited via `VSAG_USE_SYSTEM_DEPS=ON`), VSAG
looks for OpenBLAS in the following order and stops at the first hit:

1. an `OpenBLAS::OpenBLAS` target already defined by a parent project,
2. `find_package(OpenBLAS CONFIG)`,
3. a manual search for `libopenblas` plus `cblas.h` / `lapacke.h` under common system
   prefixes, including Homebrew's OpenBLAS prefixes on macOS.

Example:

```bash
# Install OpenBLAS on Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapacke-dev

# Install OpenBLAS on macOS
brew install openblas

# Build with system OpenBLAS
cmake -DVSAG_USE_SYSTEM_OPENBLAS=ON -DENABLE_INTEL_MKL=OFF -B build
cmake --build build
```

The legacy switch **`USE_SYSTEM_OPENBLAS`** (default: `OFF`) is kept as a deprecated
alias. When `VSAG_USE_SYSTEM_OPENBLAS` is empty, setting `USE_SYSTEM_OPENBLAS=ON`
preserves its previous "try system, fall back to bundled" behaviour (equivalent to
`VSAG_USE_SYSTEM_OPENBLAS=AUTO` — it does **not** hard-require a system copy). Prefer
the new option in new scripts.

### Third-Party Source Overrides

VSAG downloads its third-party libraries at configure/build time. Each downloaded
dependency honors a pin-qualified `VSAG_THIRDPARTY_<LIB>_<PIN_SUFFIX>` **environment
variable** that, when set, is tried before the upstream URL and project mirror. The
unversioned variable remains as a deprecated compatibility fallback. The value may
be a local filesystem path or URL, making this the primary mechanism for offline,
air-gapped, or internal-mirror builds.

- **`VSAG_THIRDPARTY_OPENBLAS_0_3_24`** (representative `main` example)
  - Override the OpenBLAS source archive URL/path used by `ExternalProject_Add`
  - Useful for offline builds, local mirrors, or pre-downloaded archives

The full list of pinned variables, suffix rules, usage examples, and exact archives to mirror are
documented in the [Offline / Air-gapped Builds](docs/docs/en/src/development/offline_build.md)
guide. The note next to each `URL_HASH` in `extern/<lib>/<lib>.cmake` is the
source of truth for the exact upstream URL and expected checksum.

### Other Build Options

- **`ENABLE_TESTS`** (default: `OFF`)
  - Build unit tests and functional tests

- **`ENABLE_EXAMPLES`** (default: `OFF`)
  - Build C++ example programs under `examples/cpp/`

- **`ENABLE_TOOLS`** (default: `OFF`)
  - Build tools under `tools/`

- **`ENABLE_PYBINDS`** (default: `OFF`)
  - Build the `_pyvsag` Python extension module

- **`ENABLE_MOCKIMPL`** (default: `OFF`)
  - Build the `mockimpl` targets used by interface and compatibility-style testing

- **`ENABLE_CUDA`** (default: `OFF`, x86_64 with an NVIDIA toolkit only)
  - Build the optional CUDA backend that can train IVF centroids on a device.
    Requires `CUDAToolkit`. `VSAG_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` (default
    `70;75;80;86;89;90`) selects which architectures to generate code for.
  - With the option off, a stub with the same symbols is compiled and every
    caller keeps its CPU path, so the build is byte-identical in behaviour.
  - Turning the option on is not enough on its own: an index also has to ask
    for the backend with `enable_gpu_build`, which defaults to `false`. See
    [IVF > GPU-accelerated training](docs/docs/en/src/indexes/ivf.md#gpu-accelerated-training).
  - CI runners have no GPU, so the kernels are not exercised there. The sizing
    decisions they depend on live in `src/gpu/gpu_plan.h`, free of CUDA, and are
    covered by `src/gpu/gpu_plan_test.cpp`.

For a complete list of build options, see the `option()` directives in `cmake/VSAGOptions.cmake`.
